     <h3> Mars needs Moms</h3>
     <p> What films will you find on this list of family scifi films?? E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial brought new life to the genre, telling the gentle story of young Elliot (Henry Thomas) and his adorable new friend from the cosmos. Though the Steven Spielberg-directed film was released back in 1982, it is still a favorite with families all over the world. WALL-E is another engaging movie that is entertaining for the whole family. Legos have been popular childhood toys for generations, so it came as no surprise that parents and kids alike loved The Lego Movie. Other good films featured on this list include The Incredibles, Flight of the Navigator, and Treasure Planet.</p>
     <h4>Around the world in 80 Days</h4>
     	
     <p> This 2004 rendition of the classic Jules Verne tale stars martial-arts hero Jackie Chan as Passepartout, a bank robber who hides from the cops by becoming a valet for eccentric inventor Phileas Fogg (Steve Coogan). When Fogg is coaxed into taking a bet that he can traverse the globe in 80 days, Passepartout goes along for the adventure.

The flick was denounced by critics for straying too far from the original novel, among other issues. Razzie Awards were doled out for Worst Remake or Sequel as well as Worst Supporting Actor, thanks to a less-than-stellar performance by Arnold Schwarzenegger.
